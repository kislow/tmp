# Merging – Bash Tools Challenge

This repo contains 3 small Bash tools. Your mission:
- Create your branch
- Make overlapping edits in ALL files
- Merge everything
- Fix all conflicts without breaking the scripts

## TEAM CHANGES (ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST EDIT THIS SECTION)

- Participant 1: Describe your edits to all 3 scripts
- Participant 2: Describe your edits to all 3 scripts
- Participant 3: Describe your edits to all 3 scripts

This will DEFINITELY create merge conflicts. Enjoy 😄
