# Terraform Modules

## Split a Terraform Module into Proper Files

You are given a working Terraform module where **everything is written
in a single file**.

Your task is to **refactor this module** into proper Terraform files.

This task is about **structure and best practices**, not new logic.

------------------------------------
### WHAT YOU ARE GIVEN
------------------------------------

A single Terraform file that contains:

- provider requirements
- variables
- resources
- outputs

The module works, but it is NOT well structured.

------------------------------------
### YOUR TASK
------------------------------------

1. Split the module into the following files
2. Each file must contain only what belongs there
